          Contrary to what you may think, this is not eating much.
          Make it smaller than 4k only if you are very limited on memory.

        bool "Allow vi to display 8-bit chars (otherwise shows dots)"
        default n
        help
          If your terminal can display characters with high bit set,
          you may want to enable this. Note: vi is not Unicode-capable.
          If your terminal combines several 8-bit bytes into one character
          (as in Unicode mode), this will not work properly.

    config VI_ENABLE_COLON
        bool "Enable \":\" colon commands (no \"ex\" mode)"

          Enable a limited set of colon commands for vi. This does not
          provide an "ex" mode.

          This will enable you to use yank and put, as well as mark in
          busybox vi.

          busybox vi.

          Make busybox vi remember the last command and be able to repeat it.

    config VI_ENABLE_READONLY
        bool "Enable -R option and \"view\" mode"
        default y
        help
          Enable the read-only command line option, which allows the user to
          open a file in read-only mode.

    config VI_ENABLE_SETOPTS
        bool "Enable set-able options, ai ic showmatch"

    config VI_ENABLE_VI_ASK_TERMINAL
        bool "Use 'tell me cursor position' ESC sequence to measure window"
        default y
        help
          If terminal size can't be retrieved and $LINES/$COLUMNS are not set,
          this option makes vi perform a last-ditch effort to find it:
          position cursor to 999,999 and ask terminal to report real
          cursor position using "ESC [ 6 n" escape sequence, then read stdin.

          This is not clean but helps a lot on serial lines and such.
    config VI_ENABLE_UNDO
        bool "Support undo command 'u'"
        default y

          Support the 'u' command to undo insertion, deletion, and replacement
          of text.
    config VI_ENABLE_UNDO_QUEUE
        bool "Enable undo operation queuing"
        default y
        depends on VI_ENABLE_UNDO
        help
          The vi undo functions can use an intermediate queue to greatly lower
          malloc() calls and overhead. When the maximum size of this queue is
          reached, the contents of the queue are committed to the undo stack.
          This increases the size of the undo code and allows some undo
          operations (especially un-typing/backspacing) to be far more useful.
    config VI_UNDO_QUEUE_MAX
        int "Maximum undo character queue size"
        default 256
        range 32 65536
        depends on VI_ENABLE_UNDO_QUEUE
        help
          This option sets the number of bytes used at runtime for the queue.
          Smaller values will create more undo objects and reduce the amount
          of typed or backspaced characters that are grouped into one undo
          operation; larger values increase the potential size of each undo
          and will generally malloc() larger objects and less frequently.
          Unless you want more (or less) frequent "undo points" while typing,
          you should probably leave this unchanged.
